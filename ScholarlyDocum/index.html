      <p>
        This shooter game dares to combine the competitive spirit given by arcade games
		with the possibility of learning new things! In other words, having the chance
		to compete based on general culture.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        StackInvaders (or based on the initial name: WAgI) is an arcade-shooter themed game
		with an unique aim: players are competing based on different questions from StackOverflow's site!
		By this, if the player has enough knowledge about the vast domain of IT, he'll be able to prove
		himself by solving these questions and climbing the leaderboards!

      <h2>Structure</h2>
	  
      <p>
        Client-side: a client/user on our website will be able to use the following:
		<ul>
            <li>Play: here, he'll be asked to insert his nickname and be introduced in our game's theme.
            Here, after every defeated waves, a boss will be spawned and he'll need to answer different questions in order to truly defeat it.</li>
            <li>About: a short history that will introduce our user to the game's theme</li>
            <li>HowToPlay: a page dedicated to learning basic movements/actions for player</li>
            <li>Highscore: here, the users will be able to see how high are they placed</li>
		</ul>
		And by using:
		<ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
		</ul>

      <section id="arhitecture">
        <h3>Arhitecture</h3>
		
        <p>
          Based on our needs and past experiences, we went for a MVC type of application, being programmed in C# language,
		  using ASP .NET CORE 2.0.
        </p>
		
        <p>
          The simple logic behind this type of arhitecture and our application is: the user will interact directly with the Views and
		  based on his requests, where are parsed at controller which will change/adapt to them and send this notification back
		  to Views and Models. Models have the role more related to application's logic, being in direct connection with the Views.

      <section id="apis">
        <h3>APIs</h3>
		
        <p>
          As the title sugests, we had to use apis in order to:
		  <ol>
		  <li>Connect with a social media website: we went with Facebook's API and we used it to share player's score/achievement with others!</li>
		  <li>Generate questions: we used StackExchange's API to generate the specified questions, using their filter/query to navigate through 
		  one of their sites: stackoverflow</li>
		  </ol>

        <h3>Source-code management</h3>
		
        <p>
          We used Github as a Version Control System, simply because we became used with the platform from multiple projects that we had.

        <h3>First phase</h3>
        <p>
			At first, we went for an oddly-themed shooter, with a more fantasy/horror like experience. But after
			thoughts and general impression given by this idea, we wanted to give it a fresh, more arcade-game like
			feeling.

      <h2>Second Phase</h2>
      <p>
		Represents the current solution, where the spaceships/menu & background' theme were inspired by the well-known franchise "Star Wars".
		Same goes for the game itself, its gameplay being influenced by an old game, as hinted in the name.

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
		As a conclusion to this project finalisation, we are glad to say that the final result is one to be proud of, being a good-feeling,
		fun to play and learning chance game. Despite the work we invested in it, we also got many in returns, from a fresh reminder of
		HTML & CSS, we had the opportunity to learn java, to understand it's importance for the client and it's flexibility towards the entire
		application.
